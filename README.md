Inspiration: 
Nikki’s ( classmate/ friend ) Style 
→ Mixed media between real and flat colors

Tomodachi Life 
→ I’ve been playing tomodachi on my DS every since Nintendo released their news for the new tomodachi game. I love the mixed media in that game, and I decided to bring that into life with my quiz. My style has been quite the same for a while, it leans towards cute and pastels. While trying to honor that style, I wanted to try new media. 

Process
I grey-boxed a HORRENDOUS quiz, creating the plainest looking “thing” ever.
→ kind of frustrated me due to my hatred for the “trust the vision” process
→ I couldn’t visualize anything, so I started to slap in test pictures and tomodachi-like fonts (noncompatible with CSS VSC), and it allowed me to feel at ease

Final
Mixing animations + transitions allowed my quiz to come alive
→ Especially when you make the screen smaller, the colors change ( first page only; I LOVE HOW IT LOOKS; I LOVE the smooth transitions between the colors )

Challenges
Audio
→ I am only familiar with p5js’s audio system, so it was really difficult to transfer my knowledge over to VSC.
→ I tried to follow YouTube videos = did not work out because I didn’t get it 
→ glitched alot
CSS
→ Slight aligning troubles ( centering/right/left ) with buttons → kept it centered 


Future
I want to fix and play around with audio and sound effects.
Cool ocean wave Page transitions ( i found a tutorial and I wanted to follow it but I did not have enough time to fully learn how to do this with doing copy and paste code )
Figure out how to do color font transitions based on the color image u picked
→ I believe I can use local save with my fav color code and add a font color text below it, however, I wouldnt know how to change it in the @media since its not ID or a class ( maybe
