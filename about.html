        Hello ! If you are new year, this is my second version 
        of my past cc portfolio. This time I decided to go for a plain and simple 
        portfolio. If you look at cc sem 1, you can see the essence of my past portfolio!
        I like keeping old projects as a reminder of what my thought process was at that time.

        Currently, my style is in it's cartoon phase ( when has it not been ) but I am 
        trying to leave that style behind but it's quite hard to relearn something you've
        haven't done in a while. I love learning new ways to draw, styles, colors, and textures.
        I think my favoirte type of art is mixed media, espically using found items like popsicle sticks,
        fluff, glitter, and my ALL TIME FAVORITE: googly eyes!!
