            <p>A picture created from simple shapes based off of my partner Z's description of an object!</p>
            <p>I had to guess what his object was off of his really vague description of a stuffed animal.</p>
            <p>I thought it was a huge and tall one, but... it was a pretty medium-sized stuffed bear.</p>
            <p>heh oops!</p>
